# JurassicParkReboot
Personalized Jurassic Park website I created in my Web Development course at Weber State University. The information used in my revision is used from the original website http://www.lost-world.com/Lost_World02/inGENe.html which is no longer live. Included is a "Match the Dinosaur" game along with other informative pages about the fictional Jurassic Park. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (mostly inline with the HTML and not in separate script folders since this is an older assignment), and PHP for the mobile sizing. Below are some of the HTML pages for visuals but can also be located in the ShowcaseImages folder in this repo.
